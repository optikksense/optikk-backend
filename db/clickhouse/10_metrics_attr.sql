-- Metrics attribute (label) dictionary. Resolves the per-data-point attributes
-- JSON by attr_hash before the rollup scan — the data-point analog of
-- metrics_resource (which resolves resource dims by fingerprint).
--
-- The same attribute set repeats on every rollup row of a series for every
-- minute it is active (~187x in practice). Storing it once per (metric_name,
-- attr_hash, bucket) here keeps the JSON — 34% of metrics_1m's scanned bytes —
-- off the hot value/percentile path. Readers join on attr_hash when a query
-- groups or filters by a non-resource label (e.g. db.name), and faceting reads
-- this table directly. metric_name leads attr_hash so faceting and the
-- attr-resolution CTE stay scoped to a single metric on a contiguous range.
-- ts_bucket carries the 5-min Go-side value through from the raw table for
-- time pruning.
